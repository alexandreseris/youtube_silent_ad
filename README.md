*Mute video ads and skip them when possible. close text and image banner on Youtube*

## CLOSED PROJET
Does not work whith the newer versions of youtube and the site is smart enough to skip the add when using devtools

If you have an idea on how to get around this behaviour, you can open a PR or an issue :)
